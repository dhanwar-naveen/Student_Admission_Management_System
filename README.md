CDAC's PGDAC's Project

SAMS (Student Admission Management System) is a web-based application that streamlines the onboarding process for students enrolling in a particular course. With SAMS, students can submit their admission documents, track the status of their application, and receive updates on their admission status. Administrators can use SAMS to manage student applications, track the progress of each application, and generate reports related to the admission process.

This repository contains the source code for SAMS, which is built using JavaScript, Express.js and CSS etc.. The code is organized into different modules, each of which handles a specific aspect of the admission process, such as document submission, document verification, and admission status tracking.

Feel free to clone this repository and use the code as a starting point for your own admission management system. If you encounter any issues or have suggestions for improving SAMS, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue.

Thank you for your interest in SAMS!
